## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

 While working through this project, my major learning was how to use the <details> and <summary> tags and their properties.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on improving the use of flexbox , given that I am not yet completely comfortable with responsive layout techniques and that I need to refine my skills with such a concept. I also need to learn how to manipulate SVG.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Details Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this content.
